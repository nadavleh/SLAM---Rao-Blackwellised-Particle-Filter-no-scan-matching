# SLAM---Rao-Blackwellised-Particle-Filter-no-scan-matching

This is a gazebo simulation based SLAM using Rao-Blackwellised Particle Filter (RBPF), with no scan matching (which improves the SLAM significantly)

The file robot1.mat contains data collected from a Gazebo simulation, and consists of odometry-data, Lidar scans, true positions, etc.
Inorder to run the simulation just put all the files in the same folder (or add their location to the MATLAB's path) and run SLAM_different_Np_Nm_V4.m
file. It is well documented with notes (sorry for any typos, im not a native english speaker), as all the other functions in this reposetory.
